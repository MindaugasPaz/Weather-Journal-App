## Project Environment setup

### Node and Express Environemnt
In this project we are using Node and Express environemnts. Node and Express should be installed on the local machine. The project file server.js should require express(), and should create an instance of their app using express.

The Express app instance should be pointed to the project folder with .html, .css, and .js files.

### Project Dependencies
The ‘cors’ package should be installed in the project from the command line, required in the project file server.js, and the instance of the app should be setup to use cors().

The body-parser package should be installed and included in the project.

Local server should be running and producing feedback to the Command Line through a working callback function.

### API Credentials
Create API credentials on OpenWeatherMap.com or use existing API key inside :)
